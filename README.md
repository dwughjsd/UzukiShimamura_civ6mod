# Uzuki leads 346 / Landsol

This mod aims to be an example for creating a custom leader leading more than one civilizations for Sid Meier's Civilization VI. It was published to Steam Workshop, but I decided to distribute it only through GitHub for now.

All art assets and music files are extracted from the mobile game Princess Connect Re:Dive or the Mobile game Idolmaster: Cinderella Girls (with some modifications to make them fit in Civ6), I don't own copyright of them.

Codes that I wrote can be seen as if they're in public domain, so that you can copy, edit, redistribute them or do whatever you want.

See Releases if you just simply want to play prebuilt mod.
